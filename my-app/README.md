# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

#PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is a weather app where you  can search for a city/town/village and see the weather for the week (7 days), along with seeing it on a google map. You are able to save searches in your history.

#APIs AND FRAMEWORKS USED
Frameworks used:
React.js

APIs used:
OpenweatherMapAPI
GeoDB Cities API
Google maps API

#COMPARISON
React vs Angular:
React has a simpler learning curve compared to Angular which made it advantagious for us who have no/little experience using either of the frameworks, to learn angular would be harder due to having to learn typescript (for example). Reacts virtual DOM would also provide a faster rendering of the changes in the weather if the weather app was to be realized.

OpenweatherMap API vs Dark Sky API:
The main benefit of using OpenweatherMap is that it has a free version while Dark sky does not. Even if Dark Sky does provide more in detail coverage it is mainly focused on the USA, while we want to be able to show the weather world wide.

GeoDB Cities API vs GeoNames:
GeoDB Cities is as its name implies focused on cities while GeoNames are place names. Though it would be a good idea to include both GeoDB is the better option as most people live in cities. GeODB also lists nearby cities if instructed.

Google Maps API vs Bing Maps:
Google maps is more popular and well known to users than Bing maps. Google Maps is also able to easily be used in combination with other google products such as street view/etc.. It is also more reliable than Bing due to the fact that Google is a bigger and richer company.
